At the moment of writing this text, over 7,000 copies of this interpreter have been 
downloaded. Actually I do not have a clue what the interpreter is used for, as I 
receive very little feedback. No doubt there will be many downloads where people 
have a quick look at it and then come to the conclusion they won’t be going to use it. 
But if you serves a useful purpose for you, I would appreciate to hear about that!
