
From "Winning Ways, Volume 3", page 757:

"Clobbers was invented in the summer of 2002 by Michael Albert, J.P. Grossman and Richard Nowakowski.  
The first tournament was held at an academic conference on combinatorial game theory in Daghstuhl, 
Germany, in February 2002."

and

"The legal moves of any piece are the intersection of a chess king and a chess rook (i.e. one square
in any of four directions).  We call such a piece a "duke".  The game begins with all squares on a 
rectangular board occupied according to their colors on a checkerboard: each white square occupied
by a white duke, and each black square by a black duke.  Capturing occurs as in chess, one moves onto
the square occupied by the opponent's duke, which is then removed from the board.  But in Clobber, 
every move MUST be a capture."

The game ends when the player to move doesn't have a legal move.
